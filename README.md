Task Management System (Java, Swing)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Task Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to efficiently manage tasks using an interactive GUI built with Java Swing. It allows users to add, update, delete, and list tasks dynamically, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

ðŸš€ How We Created It

Project Setup: Initialized the project in IntelliJ IDEA and structured it using Java packages.
Core Functionality: Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for task management.
GUI Development: Designed a user-friendly Swing-based interface for seamless interaction.
Debugging & Optimization: Refined the project using AI assistance (ChatGPT) to enhance efficiency.
Version Control: Managed the project using Git and uploaded it to GitHub.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Java â€“ Core language for development.
Java Swing â€“ For designing the graphical user interface.
OOP Principles â€“ Ensured modularity and reusability.
Git & GitHub â€“ For version control and collaboration.

ðŸ¤– Role of AI in This System

AI assistance, primarily ChatGPT, helped in:
âœ… Code Optimization â€“ Improving logic and efficiency.
âœ… Bug Fixing â€“ Debugging and resolving errors in Java code.
âœ… Feature Enhancement â€“ Providing guidance for adding and refining functionalities.
âœ… Documentation & Best Practices â€“ Suggesting professional coding standards and project structuring.
